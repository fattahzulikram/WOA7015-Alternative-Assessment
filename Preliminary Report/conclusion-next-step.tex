\section{Summary and Next Step}

This report presents a proposal of benchmarking a CNN-LSTM hybrid model against the BioMedBLIP model on the SLAKE dataset. Following this 
proposal, the baseline model is implemented and evaluated on the dataset. The model has achieved notable success in the classification-based 
VQA task.

The future steps following the completion of the baseline include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fine-tuning BioMedBLIP on the SLAKE dataset for the VQA task using the same dataset split for fair comparison.
    \item Conducting similar evaluations using all the selected metrics.
    \item Answering the research questions presented as the objectives.
\end{itemize}
